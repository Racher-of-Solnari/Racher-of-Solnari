profile was made on mobile, thats why some symbols may be missing (i use mobile and pc interchangably so i am aware of this)

account used only 4 rerir ponies.. for the most part heh.. sorry gang i just love him so much ðŸ˜¿

p.s i lowk don't get why people hate nonsharing yumes.. i've never met any weird ones who harrass others n its not my fault seeing other yumes of an f/o makes me weirdly sad </3
